NEWS for package moult 

Changes in version 1.4

  -- Fixed error in predict.moult.

Changes in version 1.3

  -- Bug fix: moult function did not work when added covariates for standard deviation in start date. 
     Now works, but still only for categorical covariates. 

  -- Improved row and column names for covariance matrix of parameter estimates. 

Changes in version 1.2

  -- Added reference to article in Journal of Statistical Software. 

Changes in version 1.1

  -- The 'weaver' data set now contains only adult birds, and only observations 
         from years 1988-2005.

  -- 'formula' in function 'moult' has changed to 'moult.index ~ days | x1 + x2 | y1 + y2 | z1', 
         where the x's are covariates for duration, the y's are covariates for mean start date of 
         moult and the z can be a single categorical covariate for the standard deviation in start 
         of moult. 
  
  -- The above change depends on package 'Formula'. 

  -- 'moult' now has a 'data' argument, similar to 'lm' or 'glm'. 

  -- 'predict.moult' can now be used for predicting mean starts date at different covariate settings.
